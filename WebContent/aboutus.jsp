  <h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
<dl><dt>Feel good about Yourself</dt>
<dd>Donating blood has the power to impact up to three people who need the blood to survive.

Knowing that they have made a difference to the lives of others can relieve a person's stress and make them feel mentally well or better about themselves than they did before.
</dd>
</dl>

<dt>Burns calories</dt>
<dd>Donating blood burns up to 650 calories per donation, according to the St. Mary's Medical Center, Blue Springs, MO. While giving blood should not be an alternative to exercise, the calories burned might be seen as of occasional benefit by some.

In the right person, blood donation offers many health benefits with few risks. Blood banks usually take every precaution possible to help a blood donor give their blood safely.

 <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>
When performed in a clean manner, donating blood is safe.<br><br>														
If a blood bank were to reuse needles, this could increase the risk of someone experiencing a blood-borne infection.<br><br>
																																										
For this reason, it is part of routine blood collection to use new needles for each donation and to require every person involved to wash their hands.<br><br>


The United States Food and Drug Administration monitors blood banks to make sure they are collecting blood safely.<br><br>

A person can experience some side effects, as a result of donating blood. These include:
<ul>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>feeling faint</li>
<li>lightheadedness</li>
<li>nausea</li>
</ul>
